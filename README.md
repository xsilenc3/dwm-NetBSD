# dwm-NetBSD
This is my personal repo for my build of Suckless DWM for NetBSD, it will change overtime and it's mostly vanilla but riced a bit to my liking. You can also use this as a bare bones for doing your own configures for NetBSD ricing-wise without the hassle of changing the Make files. As well, I've commented my own config.mk to better explain why my changes are how they are for anyone NetBSD curious coming over from a less hands-on BSD OS or from Linux.

Make sure to go view Suckless' webpage at https://suckless.org/ and maybe donate to them too. Happy hacking. :)
